## 1. Purpose, authority, and job boundary

This document derives the future verification baseline from the finalized Runtime Entry Resolution Contract. The Contract is the sole behavioral oracle. The Design Source remains the design authority; the general Test Strategy and the Runtime Config/Runtime Identity lifecycle records supply verification process conventions only. Existing implementation, test convenience, and adjacent-capability behavior do not add meaning.

The strategy was initially derived before test code existed. The current correction adds the complete executable test candidate and corrects only lifecycle classification. It does not create production code, an accepted Pre-RED result, a baseline, a freeze, Formal RED, GREEN, Registry transition, commit, or push. Contract review found no direct internal contradiction and no unresolved Design Authority marker.

## 2. Test levels and binding convention

| Level | Boundary | Allowed observation |
|---|---|---|
| Unit (`RER-U`) | bytes decode, duplicate-aware JSON parsing, schema/value validation, immutable value construction with controlled collaborators | typed diagnostic/result values, exact fields, ordering, purity |
| Component (`RER-C`) | one explicit Manifest path through load and physical Python-package resolution | filesystem/finder calls at public dependency boundaries, typed result/failure, short-circuit behavior |
| Integration (`RER-I`) | Entry Resolution composed with already-validated Runtime Identity and configured Runtime Config values | ownership/order boundaries and exact upstream-to-result mapping; no upstream semantic revalidation |
| Static (`RER-S`) | future public API, types, imports, source/test inventory, and prohibited dependencies | closed shape, Test-ID binding, absence of forbidden responsibility coupling |

Future test/implementation coordination should use a subsystem-local public module such as `argus.runtime.runtime_entry_resolution`, with the Contract's `resolve_runtime_entry(identity, config_snapshot, artificial_manifest_path)` operation and named immutable value/failure types. The exact Python symbol spelling is a Test Binding, not new Contract semantics; Pre-RED must freeze the chosen public binding before Formal RED. Tests assert only public values and externally observable dependency calls, not private helper names or an internal call graph.

## 3. Stable Test-ID and granularity rules

- Canonical inventory is exactly `RER-U-001..020`, `RER-C-001..025`, `RER-I-001..006`, and `RER-S-001..006` (57 IDs).
- One ID denotes one independently observable obligation. An ID is never reused, reassigned, or broadened to absorb a later correction.
- Parameterized cases may share an ID only when they are boundary representatives of the same oracle. Every case has a stable case label in test metadata/reporting.
- A test function or explicit metadata must expose exactly one primary Test ID. One function may not claim unrelated IDs merely because a common fixture reaches them.
- A later correction receives a new ID and a governed revision classification. It does not overwrite a historical binding. This rule directly prevents recurrence of the Runtime Identity Test-ID correction incident.
- Every ID below is baseline-freeze eligible (`BF=YES`) and is invoked in Formal RED (`FR=YES`) once executable test code, Pre-RED, and Human-authorized Freeze exist. `FR=YES` means inclusion in the run, not that every ID must fail. Implementation-dependent behavioral IDs are `RED_REQUIRED`; inherited regression and lifecycle/static-inventory IDs are `PASS_PERMITTED`. Eligibility and classification are not evidence that those lifecycle stages have occurred.
- `RER-I-006`, `RER-S-005`, and `RER-S-006` are `PASS_PERMITTED`: they verify inherited CLOSED upstream behavior/references, the frozen candidate inventory, and authorized scope/lifecycle state. Their legitimate PASS before Entry Resolution production exists does not invalidate Formal RED. `RER-S-001..004` remain `RED_REQUIRED` because they inspect the absent/incomplete Entry Resolution production surface. All `RER-U-*`, `RER-C-*`, and `RER-I-001..005` remain `RED_REQUIRED` because their oracles depend on Entry Resolution behavior.

## 4. Common exact oracles and non-vacuity

On failure, the public value is exactly one `RuntimeEntryResolutionFailure` containing one subsystem-local `RuntimeEntryResolutionDiagnostic(code, field_name)`. No success payload is present. OS/localized text, raw exception, stack trace, and path text are not equality fields. The first failing stage terminates processing; within schema validation the first defect follows `schema_version`, `startup`, `startup.kind`, `startup.entry`.

On success, the result is immutable and has exactly `startup_target`, `expected_binding`, and `data_root_locator`; the target is immutable and has exactly `kind`, `module_name`, and `origin_path`. Tests must compare complete public shapes, not truthiness or a subset.

Every executable behavioral test must prove Entry Resolution was exercised by all of the following applicable bindings:

1. invoke the frozen public Entry Resolution operation, not a fixture-only parser or a reimplemented oracle;
2. assert the complete typed success or failure value and the primary Test ID;
3. use a sentinel Manifest path/bytes/finder outcome that differs from defaults, so an unconditional canned result cannot pass;
4. for terminal failures, assert at least one prohibited downstream public dependency boundary has zero calls;
5. for success, assert Manifest read and finder/physical validation were actually consumed exactly as required;
6. prohibit mocks that return the expected public result directly and prohibit assertions satisfied only by import/collection failure;
7. require mutation controls at Pre-RED: changing the relevant fixture token or collaborator outcome must change/fail the observation for each requirement family.

Production-surface static tests (`RER-S-001..004`) must inspect the frozen production surface or source inventory and fail when it is absent. A no-file/no-symbol condition for those IDs is RED, never a vacuous PASS. Lifecycle/static-inventory checks (`RER-S-005..006`) inspect canonical artifacts and may PASS before production exists. `skip`, `xfail`, `Any`, `getattr`, ignore comments, broad exception swallowing, or configuration exclusion may not conceal an absent binding or unexercised path.

| Test ID | Contract | Setup / input | Expected observation | BF | FR |

| `RER-I-006` | §1-2, §5-7 | run frozen CLOSED Runtime Identity and Runtime Config affected regression selections beside RER tests | their public semantics/evidence remain inherited; no changed upstream schema, failure enum, ordering, or ownership is required for RER | YES | YES |
| `RER-S-001` | §5-6 | inspect frozen public type surface | success/target/failure/diagnostic are subsystem-local immutable typed shapes with exactly the Contract fields and closed code set | YES | YES |

| `RER-S-006` | §1, §7, §9 | repository diff/scope inventory | no Contract edit, upstream Contract/test semantic edit, production/test implementation outside the authorized future job, Registry close, or Result Manifest work is smuggled into the baseline | YES | YES |

## 8. Contract-to-test traceability and coverage

| Contract obligation group | Test IDs | Coverage statement |
|---|---|---|
| §1 authority, order, ownership | `RER-I-001..006`, `RER-S-003..004` | Entry Resolution's owned work and later/upstream boundaries remain separated |
| §2 explicit input boundary | `RER-C-001..004`, `RER-I-001..004`, `RER-S-002`, `RER-S-004` | one absolute canonical Manifest path; no discovery, config path, or upstream rerun |
| §3.1 required schema | `RER-U-001`, `RER-U-008..015` | every required field, type, and closed value has positive/negative coverage |
| §3.2 strict JSON/duplicates | `RER-U-002..007`, `RER-U-020`, `RER-C-008` | UTF-8/BOM, malformed/deep, decoded-name duplicate at all object locations, object root |
| §3.3 compatibility/unknown fields | `RER-U-006`, `RER-U-016..018`, `RER-C-024` | duplicate-first and inert ignore policy without retention/behavior changes |
| §3.4 version/normalization | `RER-U-009..010`, `RER-U-013`, `RER-U-015`, `RER-U-020` | exact version and token comparisons; no repair/coercion/normalization |
| §4 deterministic ordered resolution | `RER-C-001..022` | load once, parse order, finder, package/origin/readability oracle, determinism |
| §5 typed result/Binding inputs | `RER-C-020`, `RER-C-023..025`, `RER-I-001`, `RER-S-001..002` | exact immutable result and allowed upstream composition only |
| §6 local typed failures | `RER-U-002..015`, `RER-U-019`, `RER-C-002..019`, `RER-S-001` | all nine codes, field names, first-stage/field precedence, no raw exception leakage |
| §7 side effects/non-responsibilities | `RER-C-021..022`, `RER-C-025`, `RER-I-002..006`, `RER-S-002..004` | no inference, upstream rerun, execution, Binding, Result Manifest, or stateful side effects |
| §8 resolved testability markers | `RER-U-001..020`, `RER-C-010..025` | bytes, isolated finder, physical origin, mapping, and ordering are observable |
| §9 lifecycle disposition | §9-§15 and `RER-S-005..006` | Strategy only; downstream lifecycle remains gated and Registry stays `IN_PROGRESS` |

All normative behavior has at least one independently observable primary ID. Failure-code coverage is exact: path invalid (`C-002..004`), not found (`C-005`), read (`U-002`, `C-006..008`), malformed (`U-003`), duplicate (`U-004..006`), schema (`U-007..009`, `U-011..015`), version (`U-010`), target not found (`C-011`, `C-016`), and target invalid (`C-012..015`, `C-017..019`).

## 9. Pre-RED static checks

A future Pre-RED job must produce `PRE_RED_PASS_BASELINE_FREEZE_READY` only when all checks pass:

1. test files and helpers decode as UTF-8 and compile/parse; test collection structure is valid without executing behavioral tests;
2. AST/metadata inventory proves exactly 57 primary IDs and the four contiguous ranges in §3, with one primary binding per ID and no reuse;
3. every table row contains Contract clause, level, setup/input, complete observation, `BF`, and `FR`; future code maps bidirectionally to the row;
4. non-vacuity rules in §4 are mechanically checked, including sentinel consumption, public resolver invocation, terminal zero-call assertions, and prohibited direct-result mocks;
5. Ruff and Pyright run on the candidate tests/helpers; test-owned lint/type/config/import defects are zero;
6. absent intended production module/symbol diagnostics are isolated as `EXPECTED_STATIC_RED`, with root count and mechanically derived unknown-type count; this is not PASS;
7. syntax, wrong import path, missing dependency, malformed fixture, unrelated diagnostics, suppression, collection failure, or configuration exclusion blocks Pre-RED;
8. traceability confirms all Contract groups in §8 and all nine failure codes; unknown-field cases prove duplicate-first behavior;
9. scope inventory proves Contract and CLOSED Runtime Identity/Config semantics were not edited and no production/baseline/Registry work occurred;
10. paths and SHA-256 values for every baseline input in §10, Git HEAD/worktree state, tool/config versions, commands, and raw outputs are recorded.

Pre-RED is static validation only. It does not run the future behavioral suite against production and does not freeze anything.

## 10. Future baseline inputs and Freeze rules

The Human-authorized baseline must freeze by path plus SHA-256:

1. finalized Runtime Entry Resolution Contract;
2. approved revision of this Test Strategy;
3. complete future test files, fixtures, helpers, and Test-ID metadata;
4. accepted `PRE_RED_PASS_BASELINE_FREEZE_READY` evidence and raw static outputs;
5. `pyproject.toml` and every effective test/lint/type/static configuration file;
6. exact 57-ID inventory, bidirectional traceability report, non-vacuity report, and mutation-control report;
7. CLOSED Runtime Identity and Runtime Config Contract/test references and the selected inherited regression inventory/hashes;
8. Git HEAD, working-tree status, tracked diff hash, and hashes of untracked capability inputs;
9. reserved Formal RED run ID, expected absent-production root cause and production symbol-presence state;
10. Human approval reference, timestamp, baseline ID/version, and freeze rule.

Freeze rule: the Contract, approved Test Strategy, tests, fixtures, helpers, ID bindings, and effective configuration must not be changed merely to make production pass. Any change requires rationale, impact classification, Human approval, new hashes, repeated Pre-RED, a new freeze, and Revision RED where applicable. Historical IDs and evidence remain immutable; removal is tombstoned, not reassigned. This document supplies the future input list only and does not compute a candidate baseline or freeze it.

## 11. Formal RED requirement

Formal RED is mandatory, non-waivable, and may run only after accepted Pre-RED and Human-authorized Freeze. All frozen RER tests are invoked. Accepted RED requires every `RED_REQUIRED` ID to fail solely because the frozen Entry Resolution production surface is intentionally absent/incomplete, with test collection and test-owned static validity already established. Every `PASS_PERMITTED` ID must PASS and may not be counted as a RED failure. The run records per-ID classification and outcome, failing IDs, phase, root cause, hashes, command/tool versions, exit status, and raw output references.

Unexpected PASS by a `RED_REQUIRED` ID; any failure by a `PASS_PERMITTED` ID; wrong-reason failure; unrelated regression/environment failure; syntax/fixture/config/dependency/permission error; hash drift; skip/xfail; test weakening; or mixed expected/unexpected failure yields `FORMAL_RED_BLOCKED`, not accepted RED. Import/collection failure is acceptable only if it exactly matches the frozen absent public module/symbol root cause and does not prevent the evidence system from identifying the complete intended frozen inventory. Accepted outcome is exactly `FORMAL_RED_ACCEPTED`.

## 12. GREEN, regression, and static closure gates

After accepted Formal RED, a separate authorized implementation job may seek GREEN. Closure requires:

- all 57 frozen IDs PASS with no skip/xfail/unexpected warning and hashes matching the baseline;
- expected static RED is gone without suppression or configuration weakening;
- scoped and repository-required `pytest`, `ruff`, `pyright`, `bandit`, and `pip-audit` results are recorded; failures are reported and current-change attribution is explicit;
- affected CLOSED Runtime Identity/Config regression selections pass unchanged, with prior evidence inherited rather than relabeled as new RER evidence;
- no Contract-external feature, fallback, environment inference, upstream semantic change, Result Manifest, Binding call, import/execution, or Registry closure was introduced;
- evidence records commands, tool versions, effective configuration hashes, exit status, raw-output hashes, test counts/IDs, code/worktree identity, and deviations.

GREEN automation does not close the capability. Registry remains `IN_PROGRESS` until independent review and the separately authorized closure transition complete.

## 13. Independent semantic review gate

An implementation author-independent reviewer must receive the Contract, approved/frozen strategy, frozen tests, full changed files/diff, Pre-RED/Freeze/RED/GREEN evidence, static/regression outputs, input manifest hash, and code/worktree identity. Review must check:

- every normative obligation and failure mapping against the Contract, especially duplicate-first unknown objects and version/type distinction;
- Test-ID granularity, one-primary-binding rule, non-vacuity, and absence of historical ID reuse;
- finder side-effect freedom, concrete package/origin/readability oracle, and no import/compile/execute expansion;
- exact result composition and no Manifest/config-path/provenance or directory-derived binding data;
- no upstream revalidation, Environment Binding, Orchestrator, Result Manifest, Registry, or later execution responsibility leakage;
- no test weakening, invented fault semantics, private-implementation overbinding, or silent baseline drift.

The reviewer returns `NO_FINDINGS` or evidence-backed findings with severity, Contract/Test-ID references, and disposition. Unresolved critical or major semantic findings block closure. Automated GREEN does not override review findings, and review does not replace deterministic test/static evidence.

## 14. Revision lifecycle

Any Contract change first returns to Design Authority and invalidates affected strategy/baseline inputs. Strategy-only clarification receives a new document revision and impact analysis. Test correction or new obligation receives new Test IDs; existing meanings/bindings remain preserved. Each revision follows: proposal and traceability impact → Human approval → revised Pre-RED → revised Freeze → Human commit checkpoint → mandatory Revision RED for changed/new security or fail-closed obligations → corrective GREEN/regression/static checks → independent review. Prior observations are not retroactively promoted to Revision RED.

Changes to schema versions, accepted kinds, launcher semantics, runtime-root containment, symlink policy, deployment metadata, or optional-field behavior are new Contract decisions, not test-strategy repair. No revision may silently reopen CLOSED Runtime Identity or Runtime Config semantics.

## 15. Strategy disposition and exact next step

This strategy is complete with 57 stable IDs, full Contract traceability, corrected Formal RED classification, and a complete executable candidate. The exact next lifecycle step is: **retry Pre-RED static validation against this strategy and candidate; do not execute behavioral RED and do not freeze until Pre-RED returns `PRE_RED_PASS_BASELINE_FREEZE_READY` and Human separately authorizes Freeze.**

## 16. Corrective revision candidate after Critical Path reproduction (2026-10-01)

This section is the current candidate semantics and supersedes conflicting inventory, S-003/S-004 oracle, C-021/I-005 aggregation, and lifecycle statements above. It does not alter the Contract and is not frozen. The initial 57-ID baseline, Formal RED, and GREEN remain immutable history; their validity is recorded in the baseline invalidation evidence.

The canonical candidate inventory is now 72 IDs: historical `RER-U-001..020`, `RER-C-001..025`, `RER-I-001..006`, `RER-S-001..006`, plus corrective `RER-U-021..022`, `RER-C-026..034`, `RER-I-007..008`, and `RER-S-007..008`. Historical IDs are not reassigned. `RER-C-021` and `RER-I-005` are deprecated as aggregated assurance claims: their existing narrow observations remain historical, while their unbound portions are restated under the new IDs below. `RER-S-003` and `RER-S-004` retain their original Contract obligations but their lexical implementations are deprecated and replaced by semantic AST/interface/runtime observations.

### 16.1 Corrected historical bindings

| Test ID | Corrected non-vacuity binding | Exact expected observation |
|---|---|---|
| `RER-U-001` | controlled finder returns a distinct concrete package origin; complete public result is consumed | exact success target, binding, and locator; canned failure cannot pass |
| `RER-U-011`, `RER-U-012`, `RER-U-014` | distinct missing sentinel and explicit JSON `null` case | missing and null independently return the exact field diagnostic |
| `RER-U-016..018`, `RER-U-020`, `RER-C-022` | controlled success/failure sentinels and complete result comparison | unknown fields, whitespace/key order, CWD/environment changes cannot make identical canned outcomes pass |
| `RER-C-025` | a `data_root_path` subtype fails on existence, file, resolution, open/read/write probes | supplied locator is preserved and every prohibited data-root probe is zero-call |
| `RER-I-001` | distinct real upstream state, data-root, environment, and path sentinels | all four values map exactly and no substitute is accepted |
| `RER-S-001` | dataclass/enum locality, frozen state, exact fields and annotations | all closed public type shapes match Contract §§5-6 |
| `RER-S-002` | exact signature parameter and return annotations | the typed public boundary is exact; arbitrary non-`Path` runtime defense is not added |
| `RER-S-003` | AST import/call/reference inventory; ordinary `ExpectedEnvironmentBinding` type import is expressly permitted | no dynamic import/eval/exec/compile or dependency that performs later responsibility; legitimate typed references require no name hiding |
| `RER-S-004` | AST and runtime spies for actual CWD, environment, directory traversal, and search-path mechanisms | no discovery or inference operation; ordinary identifiers such as `identity.environment` are expressly permitted |

### 16.2 New independently observable obligations

| Test ID | Contract | Non-vacuity binding | Exact expected observation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RER-U-021` | §§3.2-3.3 | controlled success with a valid 5000-digit integer in an unknown root member | exact success; valid ignored JSON cannot become `MALFORMED_JSON` |
| `RER-U-022` | §§3.3, 6 | huge unknown integer plus missing `schema_version` | exact `MANIFEST_SCHEMA_INVALID("schema_version")`; ignored content cannot change precedence |
| `RER-C-026` | §§4, 6 | fail-on-call filesystem and finder after lexical failure | exact path failure and zero later calls |
| `RER-C-027` | §§4, 6 | fail-on-call read/parse/finder after absence | exact not-found failure and zero later calls |
| `RER-C-028` | §§4, 6 | fail-on-call parse/finder after read failure | exact read failure and zero later calls |
| `RER-C-029` | §§4, 6 | fail-on-call schema/finder after malformed JSON | exact malformed failure and zero later calls |
| `RER-C-030` | §§4, 6 | fail-on-call finder after schema failure | exact schema failure and zero target-resolution calls |
| `RER-C-031` | §§4, 6 | missing finder result with origin/result boundaries guarded | exact target-not-found and no origin/result continuation |
| `RER-C-032` | §§4-6 | invalid origin with Binding construction fail-on-call | exact target-invalid and no result composition |
| `RER-C-033` | §§4.1, 7 | success and failure cases with compile/exec/import/process/network/clock fail-on-call | every prohibited execution/external boundary is zero-call |
| `RER-C-034` | §§4.1, 7 | manifest bytes recorded; file writes fail-on-call | Manifest and target are not mutated |
| `RER-I-007` | §§5, 7 | success and failure with real Environment Binding and Marker APIs fail-on-call | no Binding verification or Marker load/initialize |
| `RER-I-008` | §§2, 7 | path says LIVE, identity says TEST, OS environment/CWD calls fail-on-call | environment comes only from identity; no directory/environment inference |
| `RER-S-007` | §§2, 5, 7 | AST declarations and annotation assignment inventory | public types use ordinary static declarations; no globals/annotation rewriting or constructed-name `getattr` |
| `RER-S-008` | §9 | AST inventory joined to this Strategy | exactly 72 unique IDs with bidirectional traceability |

`RER-C-021` is therefore deprecated for broad side-effect assurance in favor of `RER-C-033`, `RER-C-034`, and `RER-I-007`; `RER-I-005` is deprecated for broad later-responsibility assurance in favor of `RER-C-033`, `RER-I-007`, and semantic `RER-S-003`. The old test functions and evidence are retained and are not credited for the split obligations.

### 16.3 Corrective lifecycle status

The corrected candidate is eligible only for corrected Pre-RED inspection. No Freeze, Formal Revision RED, GREEN, Registry close, commit, or push is authorized by this section. The exact next step is to perform corrected Pre-RED against the 72-ID candidate and candidate metadata; after Human approval and a new Freeze checkpoint, run Formal Revision RED before changing Production.

`RUNTIME_ENTRY_RESOLUTION_TEST_CANDIDATE_READY_FOR_PRE_RED_RETRY`

## v0.3 corrective addendum (candidate; not frozen)

The adopted executable review
`ARGUS-RUNTIME-ENTRY-RESOLUTION-CC-EXEC-PROBE-ADOPTION-20261002-001`
invalidates the affected v0.2 assurance claims while preserving their historical
records.  This addendum does not change the Contract.  It replaces lexical or
private-name coupling with observations at the public operation, actual callable
destination, result value, and filesystem byte boundary.  Instrumentation records
violations and asserts after the operation; observer callbacks never raise.

Historical IDs retain their original meaning. `RER-C-021`, `RER-C-022`,
`RER-C-034`, `RER-I-005`, `RER-I-007`, `RER-I-008`, `RER-S-003`, and
`RER-S-007` are deprecated as v0.3 assurance sources. Their v0.2 observations
remain historical but do not satisfy the successor obligations.

| Successor ID | Restates | Independent semantic observation | Expected Revision RED / GREEN |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RER-C-035` | C-021/C-034 | manifest, resolved target, and marker bytes are identical before/after on success and terminal failure | any changed byte / all unchanged |
| `RER-C-036` | C-022 | both CWD/environment variants must return the exact Contract success value and be equal | wrong/failure outcome / exact equal successes |
| `RER-C-037` | MINOR-3 evidence correction | public input remains the Contract §2 typed `Path` domain; no runtime guarantee for arbitrary non-Path values is invented | annotation drift / exact `Path` binding |
| `RER-I-009` | I-005/I-007/S-003 | non-raising call recorder observes actual upstream loader/config/identity, binding/marker, import/exec/process destinations through aliases, wrappers, and dynamic lookup | any event / no event |
| `RER-I-010` | I-008 | controlled target resolution must succeed and environment must equal `identity.environment` exactly | alternate/failure/wrong mapping / exact success |
| `RER-S-009` | S-007 | runtime public dataclass identity, locality, frozen state, ordered fields | shape violation / exact public shapes |

The canonical v0.3 candidate inventory is 78 IDs and 126 collected cases:
the complete 72-ID v0.2 inventory plus `RER-C-035..037`, `RER-I-009..010`,
and `RER-S-009`.  Non-vacuity diagnostics separately prove three legitimate
public-type construction forms are accepted, six semantic violations are rejected,
and import execution is detected through direct/from-import-equivalent, local
wrapper, dynamic-lookup, and explicit `from importlib import import_module` forms. Upstream config/identity, binding, and marker
destinations are exercised through local aliases/wrappers, while manifest, target,
and marker byte-write mutants, including a manifest mutation after terminal failure,
prove the snapshot oracle. An explicit `from subprocess import Popen` launch is
observed at both `Popen.__init__` and `_execute_child`. Three genuinely different legitimate dataclass construction
paths and six semantic shape violations pass through one runtime checker. Observer
self-tests prove callable-identity matching avoids same-name false RED, restores a
pre-existing profiler after success and exception, and converts spy failure into
recorded data plus ordinary assertions. Wrong-outcome controls exercise exact-result
rejection. The 44-case diagnostic matrix is supporting evidence,
not a Formal Revision RED/GREEN run.

`RUNTIME_ENTRY_RESOLUTION_V03_TEST_CANDIDATE_READY_FOR_PRE_RED`

The previously missing cross-JOB records were adopted on 2026-10-02 and reconciled
in `V03-PRE-RED-BLOCKER-RECONCILIATION-20261002-001`. The historical package is
`HISTORICAL_MANUAL`: Worker-observed envelope facts remain distinct from the
bounded ACTOR_REPORTED Codex judgment, and corroboration is provenance-only.
Every recoverable original blocker and every adopted Claude executable finding is
mapped to the current canonical ID or supporting diagnostic. `N-2..N-4` remain
`NOT_RECOVERED` and are not treated as closure claims or as invented blockers.
This completes blocker reconciliation without changing the Contract, Production,
or historical Test-ID meaning; the v0.3 candidate is ready for a new Pre-RED run.

## v0.3 lifecycle normalization: Test-Assurance Revision (2026-10-02)

The v0.3 addendum is classified as `TEST_ASSURANCE_REVISION`. It strengthens the
test observer, harness, counterexample, non-vacuity, and evidence/provenance
assurance around unchanged Contract obligations. It is not a Production
Revision-RED cycle. Corrected Production is already committed at
`f7926799b0c7068bcb93ce630aa1b335a117b1ee`; every applicable canonical
current-Production conformance/regression case is therefore expected to PASS.
No v0.3 Test ID is expected to be RED against that Production unless an
execution proves a violation of the unchanged Contract.

For the strengthened assurance obligations, non-vacuity is supplied separately
by semantic diagnostics: a violating mutant or counterexample must be
detected/rejected, while a legitimate variant must be accepted. A diagnostic
PASS means that its expected semantic result was observed. It is supporting
`ASSURANCE_NON_VACUITY` evidence and is not Product GREEN, Formal RED, or a
substitute for the canonical current-Production suite.

The v0.2 Revision RED and corrected GREEN records remain immutable historical
predecessor evidence. They are not relabeled or promoted. The v0.3 lifecycle is:
proposal and traceability impact → Human approval → Test-Assurance Pre-RED /
Pre-Freeze validation → Human-authorized Freeze → later assurance
maintenance and independent review as authorized. A new Formal Revision RED is
required only if a later revision changes Production/Contract behavior or if
current Production is independently proven to violate an unchanged obligation.

This normalization supersedes only conflicting v0.3 lifecycle labels such as
`REVISION_RED_REQUIRED`, `expected_v03_revision_red_observation`, and the
instruction to force current corrected Production into Revision RED. It does
not alter any Test ID, oracle, expected behavioral observation, observer,
harness, Contract meaning, or historical evidence. Registry remains
`IN_PROGRESS`; Freeze, commit, and push remain unauthorized.

`RUNTIME_ENTRY_RESOLUTION_V03_TEST_ASSURANCE_CANDIDATE_READY_FOR_PRE_FREEZE_VALIDATION`

## v0.3.1 final-review corrective Test-Assurance addendum (candidate; not frozen)

The immutable v0.3 baseline at commit
`530ac0e24e5c0a1f5d61ee98c8af6483e32ea417` remains historical evidence. The
independent executable review
`ARGUS-RUNTIME-ENTRY-RESOLUTION-V03-FINAL-EXEC-REVIEW-20261003-001` invalidates
only the affected v0.3 assurance claims: `RER-C-035` did not observe the actual
Data Root, and the raising `Path.exists` spy in `RER-C-026` could abort pytest.
This addendum is a `TEST_ASSURANCE_REVISION`; it changes neither Production nor
Contract semantics, does not close the Registry, and is not a Freeze.

Historical ID meanings are preserved. No new independently observable Contract
obligation is introduced, so no new Test ID is allocated:

| Existing ID | Corrected assurance observation | Exact expected observation |
|---|---|---|
| `RER-C-026` | record calls to the real `Path.exists` boundary while delegating to its original behavior; restore the boundary before assertions | relative-path lexical failure, zero existence calls, and no observer exception or pytest `INTERNALERROR` |
| `RER-C-035` | recursively snapshot the actual existing `config_snapshot.data_root_path`, without assuming a marker filename, together with Manifest and resolved-target bytes | no file/directory/symlink creation, modification, deletion, or type change within the Data Root on success or terminal failure; Manifest and target bytes also unchanged |

Non-vacuity diagnostics execute the resolver boundary and cover the canonical
`data_root_marker.json` write, an alternate Data Root filename, Manifest and
target writes, wrong outcomes, and the exact existence-before-lexical-validation
precedence mutant. The precedence diagnostic records the violation as data and
asserts only after `Path.exists` is restored, so detection is an ordinary test
result and the session continues. The three legitimate and six violating S-007
variants remain required regression controls.

The five diagnostics identified as self-referential by the final review are
restated to execute the Production resolver before injecting the counterexample:
the three former literal wrong-outcome cases now compare against an executed
valid success, and the byte-write cases observe resolver invocation plus the
semantic filesystem boundary. The Manifest-after-terminal-failure diagnostic
now first obtains the resolver's typed terminal failure. These diagnostics are
supporting `ASSURANCE_NON_VACUITY`, never Product GREEN.

Frozen hash history is not rewritten. The v0.3 convention hashes canonical
working-tree bytes, which can differ from Git blob/fresh-checkout bytes when Git
line-ending conversion is active. The v0.3.1 candidate continues that convention
and records the portability limitation as MINOR; it does not silently normalize
historical hashes. Candidate metadata additionally records the applicable Git
blob identity where available.

The exact next lifecycle step after all required executions and static gates pass
is Human review of the v0.3.1 Test-Assurance Pre-Freeze candidate. Freeze,
Registry closure, commit, and push remain unauthorized.
